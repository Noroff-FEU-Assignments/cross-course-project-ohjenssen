# Cross course project - Square Eyes

The cross course project was a school project. The goal was to put everything learned in HTML and CSS into learning and deliver a functional and responsive website.

## Description
Beforehand, we had been given a brief of a website that were to design and create a working prototype for. In the cross course project we were to actually write the code for the page. These were the requirements:

    The HTML should be semantic and neat.
    The CSS should follow the DRY principle and be easy to read.
    The website should be responsive and look good at every screen size with no horizontal scrollbars. Use Flexbox and CSS Grids where appropriate. Please do not use a CSS framework like Bootstrap, we want to see that you can build responsive sites without the help of a framework.
    The site should be WCAG compliant and accessibility taken into account.
    Each page should have a unique meta description, title, and h1.
    You should not use copied code in your submission. All code submitted must be written by you. You may use external sources to show you how to achieve specific effects, and these should be included in your report.
    
Since this was a cross course project, weÂ´ve also gone back on the project several times to implement new things with for example Javascript.
